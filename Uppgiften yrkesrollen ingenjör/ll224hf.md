So I've interviewed X companies. 1 of which is a freelancer based in the UK, another is a medical device startup company also based in the UK and the last one is x.
Since the first 2 companies I interviewed are based in the UK I asked questions in english, here are the questions I asked them to answer:

1. Can you provide an overview of the company and the products it offers.
2. Could you describe the typical tasks and responsibilities of a developer?
3. What is the core business idea of the company, and how does it translate into the products or services it provides?
4. What are the typical tasks in a project for a developer?
5. How does the company organize itself when it comes to working in teams?
6. How are projects typically handled, what tools are typically used to assist project handling?
7. How does the company ensure the quality of the products or services developed by the team?
8. Can you walk me through a what a typical workday looks like for a developer?

I'll go through each answer below for each company individually starting with the freelancer.

1. Can you provide an overview of the company and the products it offers.

   - I work independently as a freelance software engineer, I frequently work with small teams developing software as a service (SaaS) products, though I have recently leaned into developing video games.

2. Could you describe the typical tasks and responsibilities of a developer? - It varies massively down to the teams you work with and the size of the company you work for.
   Iâ€™ve worked in the startup space for the entirety of my professional life so I have had to do everything from writing code to setting up security on multiple servers at once.
   Typically I would say that you would be maining code, developing new features, doing admin, like pull requests on github and sorting out what tasks need to be done by whom.
3. What is the core business idea of the company, and how does it translate into the products or services it provides?
   - Core business idea is to deliver outstanding support to small companies that need short term software engineers. I keep in touch with local startup incubators/generators to let them know of my availability and what is going on inside them.
4. What are the typical tasks in a project for a developer?
   - Develop software
   - Update data structures
   - Introduce compatibility to ways of interacting with software
   - Review Pull Requests on Github
5. How does the company organize itself when it comes to working in teams?
   - Usually I will work on the back-end tasks so when I join a team we usually go through a session where we outline what the team has been doing and what they would expect me to be doing. Around a week in we will review how the new team structure to see if it is working and what can be improved
6. How are projects typically handled, what tools are typically used to assist project handling?

   - I personally found the following tools really useful in projects:
     - notion.so - project management
     - github.com - code storage
     - linear.app - project tasks
     - linode.com - hosting and servers
     - Something to view your databases an IDE (I like VS code)

7. How does the company ensure the quality of the products or services developed by the team?
   - Code reviews
   - PR reviews
   - Tech Team meetings
   - 1:1 sessions
   - Paired programming tasks
   - Code audits
   - Automated testing
   - Manual testing
8. Can you walk me through a what a typical workday looks like for a developer?
   - 0845 - review tasks on task management app
   - 0900 - morning standup where i get to outline the tasks i will do in the day
   - 0915 to 1700 develop and participate in meetings
   - 1700 - stand down call were we review the day

Next up the medical device startup.

1. Can you provide an overview of the company and the products it offers.
   - The company is a medical device startup, with aims to combines the three main breathing tests from hospital diagnostic clinics, into a web-connected and portable device. It measures lung function (spirometry), mechanics (impulse oscillometry), and inflammation (FeNO) - at a fraction of the cost of current equipment.
2. Could you describe the typical tasks and responsibilities of a developer? - Responsibilities are broken down into a few categories: Design and Testing.
   Design can involve making and designing a software solution from scratch to perform testing and validation or designing the product in CAD and testing in CAE software.
   Testing can involve using solutions made by someone else to carry out tests on the product or competitors. Or testing of an in-house software to make sure it conforms to the design specification.
3. What is the core business idea of the company, and how does it translate into the products or services it provides?
   - The core business ideas of the company are improving access to asthma monitoring so that more people can track, manage, and better treat their disease. This directly translates to the product which is built on these principles.
4. What are the typical tasks in a project for a developer?
   - Developing tools for and software for other member of the team to use for design and testing. Validating other members code to ensure it works for proposed design.
5. How does the company organize itself when it comes to working in teams?
   - The company is small and limited to four members with CEO, Bioengineer, Mechatronic Engineer, and Software Engineer. People in the team will group together based on the skills or knowledge required for any project.
6. How are projects typically handled, what tools are typically used to assist project handling?
   - Projects are assigned via MS Teams and tracked throughout progress with daily standup updates and tri-weekly meetings where progress and problems are updated.
7. How does the company ensure the quality of the products or services developed by the team?
   - The company adheres to many ISO standards and the medical device regulations (MDR). On top of that the company has a strict set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) that employees must be trained on and pass tests to certify they are implementing them. Additionally, all code is reviewed and checked by an employee not involved in the production of it.
8. Can you walk me through a what a typical workday looks like for a developer?
   - Work out plan for day and submit plan to standup.
     Layout test procedure for the day and gather tools and scripts required. If there are no relevant scripts design one.
     Carry out testing and log data appropriately so others can also interpret it.
     Summarise testing in document form with graphs and figures. Share document with team.

And lastly X.
