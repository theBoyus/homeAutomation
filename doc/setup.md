Need to finish up setup!

- To-do list
  - Add all necessary steps to set up pico with mqtt (adafruit account and such).
    - What to change in config.txt etc, that kind of thing.
  - How to connect different parts etc. (sensor and pico).
    - a connection schematic of sorts.
  - How to add accounts to website or do we just use the ones we've already created?

## Setting up an account with Adafruit

## Connecting the pico and sensor (tsl2591)

## Booting up (Necessary here?)
