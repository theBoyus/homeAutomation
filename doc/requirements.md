Make a program and interface that lets you select a lights schedule based on environmental properties such as light.

## Our requirements

- Turn a light on / off based on light levels, turn it off when light is high and on when light is low.

- Present the data on light in a graph on the website

- Schedule light on/off on web-interface.

- Maybe add more functionality/sensors and data pushing if we have time.
