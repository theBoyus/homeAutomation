# Meeting 1

If we want A grade, we need at least 1 sensor it seems.

For A grade we need to make some sort of home automation, with a webapp or website that keeps track of a light source and statistics of powerconsumption of the picom and led device.

History of powerconsumption.

Decide where the device will be put in an appartment and what sensors would be appropriate.

What is our goal, why should someone want to have our device?

Look up sensors!

# 
We're unsure of whether to go for a motionsensor to turn on/off lights. Or lightsensor to give adivce on saving electricity through recommendation based on outside light.

Lightsensors are cheaper ðŸ‘Œ

Lightsensors it is!

Website structure is functional, and sensors have been ordered.

# Meeting 2


Finalize the requierments.md and other documentation.

In general the website's presentation and use friendlyness is important. But presenting the data takes importance, is it easy to understand for people that aren't read into the project.

Make calculations on powerconsumption and decide what's best. It's not necessary to change based on conclusion but the conclusion itself is important.

If we need more meetings after new-years we should request that a couple of days before (If we really need to discuss the topic).
