Tested the stand alone sensor and the photoresistor module and the photoresistor module seemed to behave more accurate to light than the standalone.
Still we done get any convertible data really. Hopefully the adafruit gives more usable data.

After some struggles we made the adafruit sensor work. the data it gives is increadibly more detailed than the photoresistor module. Definitly more usable.

Adafruit sensor works well with micropico lib we found. it now also connects to the website and can push data aswell as pull, i.e turn on or off a light.
