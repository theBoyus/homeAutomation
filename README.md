# Homeautomation


## Smart Lighting Control System

This project introduces a user-friendly web interface designed to interact with and efficiently manage lighting schedules and behaviors based on ambient light conditions. The primary objective is to contribute to energy conservation by automating light control in a scalable manner. Given the time constraints and a small team with limited resources, the project places a strong emphasis on conceptualizing and refining the idea.

## Background and idea

We wanted to create an easy to use webinterface/app that we could interact with and easily manipulate a light's schedule or behaviour based on incomming light. As a way to save energy perhaps, that would be based on scale (how many lights are automated?) and since we're only a small team with limited resources we put the focus on the idea first. 

Our innovative approach involved a compact circuit, utilizing a Pico and sensor combination, to facilitate the exchange of data. This circuit was then meticulously coded to take intelligent actions based on user-defined parameters such as schedules and ambient light levels. The  objective was to develop a sophisticated system capable of dynamically adjusting lighting conditions, ultimately contributing to some energy savings.
